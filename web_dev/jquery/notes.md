I plan on viewing blogs and example programs using jquery. If something looks really foreign to me I plan to test it out. I will probably take one break.

I found an overview that ultimately linked me to http://try.jquery.com/. This was a great resource that had videos and multiple challenges that built up in difficulty. This is the main thing I used to learn about jQuery.
