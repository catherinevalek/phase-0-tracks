# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control lets us see the revisions and merges made to files by other individuals. It's useful because if a mistake was made there is a history of an older file that you can go back to.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch gives a copy of your project where you can make changes. It allows you to experiment and you can add or discard the changes.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records changes to your repository. A good commit message is specific.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict prevents Git from merging changes.This could happen if two people changed the same lines in the same file or if a line was deleted by one person and the other modified it.
