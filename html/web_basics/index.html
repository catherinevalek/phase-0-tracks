<p>I enjoy traveling to new places. I taught English for a year in the Czech Republic and was able to visit several countries nearby. <em>Czechia</em> is a new nickname that was given to the Czech Republic. If you ever go to the Czech Republic you <strong>must</strong> try a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolach">

</p>
<ol>

<li>Amsterdam</li>
<li>Ostrava</li>
<li>Krakow</li>
</ol>

Cities in Europe are different from American cities. I really hate driving, and I like being outdoors. So, here are some of the things I like about these cities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The public transportation/biking culture</li>
<li>Nearby natural areas</li>
<li>The friendly people</li>
</ul>
